# BuzzFeedTasty
Infinitely many Tasty videos! If you ever want to try new recipes than this website will give you a constant stream of brand new Tasty videos. Or you can just watch the videos like I do!

I used jQuery and AJAX to query [BuzzFeed's public API](https://gist.github.com/chezclem/c98b5170971c94dd1015) and styled the page with [solid](https://solid.buzzfeed.com/). If you want to view the page go [here](https://andrew-peng.github.io/BuzzFeedTasty), or you can download the files and run them locally as well. Clicking each item will take you to the respective recipe. 

TODO: Add animation to new tiles.
